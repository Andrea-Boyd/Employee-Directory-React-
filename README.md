# Employee-Directory-React-

This is an employee directory with React. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.



Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees will render. 

The user will be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
